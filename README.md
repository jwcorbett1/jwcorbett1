# About Me

I have worked as a contractor for the North Carolina Department of Transportation for the last 10 years.

My current duties include:
* developing response plans for upcoming roadwork and special events,
* maintaining three legacy database systems in coordination with the NC Department of Information Technology,
* creating reporting tools in Excel using Visual Basic and Power Query which export data from said databases,
* and designing, maintaining, and updating a shift report formatter written in HTML and Javascript.

I have a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy, which has proven exactly as useful as everyone told me.
