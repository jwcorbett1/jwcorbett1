# About Me

I have worked as a contractor for the North Carolina Department of Transportation for the last 10 years.

My current duties include:
* developing response plans to utilize ITS devices for upcoming roadwork and special events,
* maintaining 3 legacy database systems in coordination with NC Department of Information Technology,
* creating Excel workbooks using Visual Basic and Power Query to export and organize data from said databases,
* and developing, maintaining, and updating an email report formatter in HTML/CSS/Javascript used by all 5 State traffic management centers.

I have a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy, which has proven exactly as useful as everyone told me.

## Fun Fact

The strangest language I have ever worked in was a bytecode scripting language EA used in "The Sims 2" called SimAntics.  At the time, I had 300+ mods and some of them stopped playing nicely together.  Rather than choose which mods to remove, I learned just enough SimAntics to locate, override, and merge the conflicting functions so I could keep using all of my mods together.
