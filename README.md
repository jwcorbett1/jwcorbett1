# About Me

I am a philosophy graduate with experience in practical programming and guiding projects from concept to deployment.  My goal is to become a full-stack developer for real-world tools and applications.

I have been a consultant for the North Carolina Department of Transportation for over a decade, with duties including:
* maintaining legacy databases in coordination with the NC Department of Information Technology,
* developing and maintaining a library of macro-enabled Excel workbooks to fetch data from databases using Visual Basic and Power Query,
* developing, maintaining, and expanding an [end-of-shift report formatter](https://github.com/jwcorbett1/Shift-Update-Template) in HTML/CSS/Javascript used by all State-level traffic management centers.

## Programming Languages & Technologies

I have done meaningful work in:
* C (personal favorite), C++, C#, Java, and Python
* HTML/CSS/Javascript
* SQL, Power Query, and Visual Basic
* Win32 API, COM (Component Object Model), Direct2D, and XAudio2

### Fun Fact

The strangest language I have worked in is SimAntics, a bytecode scripting language EA used in "The Sims 2".  At the time, I had 300+ mods and some of them stopped playing nicely together.  Rather than choose which mods to remove, I learned enough SimAntics to locate and override/merge the conflicting functions so I could keep using all of the mods.

## Repositories

* [Shift Update Template](https://github.com/jwcorbett1/Shift-Update-Template) - I created a local website in HTML/CSS/Javascript to enforce a consistent end-of-shift report structure across 24/7 operations.
* [ICM Device Test Daily Report](https://github.com/jwcorbett1/ICM-Device-Test-Daily-Report) - I created a configurable status report generator in Excel using Visual Basic and Power Query for monitoring critical ITS device uptimes.
* ICM Response Database (Front End) - I optimized the front end of a legacy Access database which returns pre-planned responses for crashes in ICM zones.
