# About Me

I have a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy, which has proven exactly as useful as everyone told me it would be.

I work as a contractor for the North Carolina Department of Transportation.  My current duties include:
* developing response plans for upcoming roadwork and special events,
* maintaining three legacy database systems,
* creating reporting tools in Excel using Visual Basic and Power Query,
* and designing, maintaining, and updating a shift update formatter written in HTML and Javascript.
